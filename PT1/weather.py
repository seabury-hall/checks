# Task: Write a program that asks the user what the weather is like and tell them what to wear
# You must have a function named 'suggest_clothing' that takes a string parameter 'weather'
# The function should RETURN a message suggesting appropriate clothing based on the given weather.
# You must have a main function that gets user input, calls the function to suggest clothing, and prints the response.
# Code must use a MATCH statement and be structured like our other programs!

# Here are the suggested clothing based on different weather conditions:
# - Sunny: Wear light and breathable clothes, such as shorts, t-shirts, and sunglasses.
# - Cloudy: Dress in layers with a light jacket or sweater, and comfortable pants or jeans.
# - Rainy: Wear a waterproof jacket or raincoat, waterproof shoes or boots, and carry an umbrella.
# - Snowy: Bundle up with a heavy coat, gloves, scarf, and hat, along with waterproof boots.
# - Windy: Wear wind-resistant clothing, such as a windbreaker or jacket, and secure accessories like hats and scarves.
# - Extreme Heat: Dress in loose-fitting, light-colored clothes made of breathable fabrics like cotton, and wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunscreen.
